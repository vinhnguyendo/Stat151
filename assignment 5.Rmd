###Q1 Discussion
According to Model 1, the probability that a typical female student is willing to tutor is 93 percent.    The typical male student is 8 percentage points less likely to tutor, and this difference is statistically significant (< 0.001 level).  Additionally, we are 95 percent confident that the plausible values for the probability that typical female student is willing to tutor ranges 90 to 95 percent and 82 to 88 percent for the typical male.

Our slope and intercept are perfectly correlated (-1).  This makes sense because if we know how many girls are willing to tutor, we know how many boys are willing to tutor.  Normally, we would decenter our predictor variable, but in this case, weâ€™re using dichotomous gender variable.  We thought a similar solution would be to include an interaction term for the proportion of male students in the school (PROPMALE).  The slope and intercept for this model are still perfectly correlated (-1).

###Q2 Discussion
There is some evidence of model misfit in the plot that depicts predicted probabilities (Plot Q2.2). Specifically, it suggests a smooth trend between predicted, school-level probabilities of male and female willingness to tutor, but does not capture the variation seen in the plot depicting raw, school-level proportions (Plot Q.2.1) of male and female willingness to tutor.

###Q3 Discussion
There is an improvement in this model because after we account for school type and grand mean centered school-level sense of belonging, the variance component for the intercept goes from 0.46 to 0.18.  That is, roughly 60 percent of the variance in a studentlog-odds

###Q5 Discussion
Plots Q5.1 the predicted probabilities of willingness to tutor by gender and school type, as well as the 95 percent confidence intervals. For each school type, the model suggests that the typical female student has a higher probability of being willing to tutor than does the typical male student.  The range of plausible


, while Q5.2 does the same for gender and school-level belonging.
